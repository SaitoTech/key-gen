# key-gen
saito keypair generator

This is a simple tool built in Electron to allow creation and recovery (from seed) of Saito complient public/private key pairs.

The application can be run off line for maxium security, and does not have any system dependencies.

> Do not share private keys with anyone. These can be used to gain complete control of a Saito wallet and any funds in it.

## Usage

### Generate a new Key Pair

"Generate Keys" can be clicked multiple times if you want to try for a 'vanity key' with some particular letters in it.

The application does not keep _any_ record of the keys it generates - for security.

Storing your keys:

You can:

* use the copy buttons to copy your keys to a file you store scurely.
* print the keys and store the paper some place safe (recommened for convenience and security)
* write down the seed on paper and store this in a safe place. (recommended for maximum security)

> Before settling on your private key - test that you can recover it with the Key Generator.
